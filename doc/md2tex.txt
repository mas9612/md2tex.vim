INTRODUCTION					*md2tex*

md2tex.vim is a plugin to generate LaTeX or PDF from Markdown by using Pandoc.

To use this plugin, you must install fireport.sty to compile TeX.
fireport.sty is available from https://github.com/High-Hill/tex_gaiyo.

You need to install pandoc command to generate LaTeX file, latexmk command to
generate PDF.

COMMANDS					*md2tex-commands*

:Md2Tex						*:Md2Tex*
	Generate LaTeX file from current file.

:Md2Pdf						*:Md2Pdf*
	Generate PDF file from current file. Note that this command call

>
	LaTeX Error: This file needs format `pLaTeX2e' but this is
	`LaTeX2e'.

	you need to set some latexmk's option in ~/.latexmkrc.
	Example .latexmkrc is below.

	#!/usr/bin/perl

	$latex = 'platex -interaction=nonstopmode -kanji=utf-8 %O %S';
	$dvipdf = 'dvipdfmx %O -o %D %S';
	$bibtex = 'pbibtex';
	$max_repeat = 5;
